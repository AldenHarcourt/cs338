Level 0:
Input ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org to connect to bandit as user bandit0
even though text doesn't appear when typed, type bandit0 and enter to login

My working directory: tmp.ZD1gdL2hc4

-a, -all to find entries hidden wiht . using ls 
cat will display a file's contents

level 0-1:
use ls cmd to read see all contents
use cat cmd on readme file to read file
PSWRD to L1: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5I

Level 1:
ls cmd to see directory contents
- is only apparent file
cat on its own won't open - so use ./- to open -
PSWRD to L2: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

Level 2:
ls cmd to see visible directory contents
spaces in this filename appears to be a file
need to use "" in cat "spaces in this filename" for cat to recognize it all as one file
this cmd returns the password
PSWRD to L3: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

Level 3:
ls cmd shows directoy inhere
cd inhere to change directories
ls shows no files so use ls -a to show hidden files
...Hiding-From-You file is shown
That was super cool!
cat ...Hiding-From-You gives password
PSWRD: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

Level 4:
ls shows inhere directory
cd to inhere directory
ls shows 10 files
I went through each using file <filename> to find the data type
-file07 is ASCII text
cat ./-file07 gives password
Alternatively it looks like you can use file ./* to see all filetypes which is mroe efficient
PSWRD: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

Level 5:
ls to find inhere directory
cd inhere 
ls shows there are many files
We know file is 1033 bytes
use du -ab to show the byte size of all files under the directory
./maybehere07/.file2 appears to be 1033 bytes
cd to maybehere07
cat .file2 gives password

Level 6:
ls -a shows a couple directories and a few files with no immediate leads
I tried find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 but got permission denied errors
Found that using 2> /dev/null will get rid of the errors
The only file that appears is /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password gives the password

Level 7:
ls shows data.txt file
cat data.txt gives too much output to parse on own
I used cat data.txt | grep  millionth to find the output in the line for millionth
this gave the password
PSWRD to L8: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

Level 8:
sort data.txt | uniq -u sorts the text file and then uniq -u only outputs the unique line
THis gives the password
PSWRD to L9: 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM

Level 9:
ls shows data.txt file
We know it is human readable and preceded by a couple of ==
strings data.txt | grep == shows the password
PSWRD to L10: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

Level 10:
using base64 -d data.txt decodes the data from base 64 to what I want
PSWRD to L11: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr

Level 11:
The password has been encoded by shifting each letter to the letter 13 away from it
cat data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]' decoded the password
'[A-Za-z]' is the first input set to tr and tr maps the second input set, '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]' onto the letters in the first set
At least I'm pretty sure that's how this works
